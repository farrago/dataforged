      Description: |-
        Themes help you envision atmosphere, features, and encounters within an unusual, aberrant, or important location. You can answer questions about a place using only the tables provided for a theme, such as when delving into an **Infested** cave. Or you can pair a theme with other location oracles for more flavor and variety; for example, you might explore a **Haunted Grave World**, a **Ruined Derelict**, a **Sacred Precusor Vault**, or an **Inhabited Settlement**.
