    # Summary: Exploring Precursor Vaults
    When you first come upon a vault, you can use the tables on the previous two pages to help envision its form and nature. For a more abstract prompt, just use the Descriptor oracle (page 294). In either case—if that’s enough detail for the role of the vault in your story—stop there.

    ## Detailed Precursor Vault Generation
    If the survey of a vault is a focus for your current quest, you can use the oracle tables in this section to generate a more complete picture of the site. See the next page for a diagram of the three main phases of exploration.

      * **Exterior:** Start by generating the basic form and characteristics of the vault using the tables on the previous two pages. These features
    represent what you observe from a safe distance.
      * **Interior:** If you enter the site, check the Inner First Look table (page 360) for initial impressions of what lies within. If you explore further, use the Interior Feature table (page 362) to define what you find or encounter. If you [Undertake an Expedition](#Undertake-an-Expedition) within a vault, check this table if you want help setting the scene for a waypoint.
      * **Sanctum:** As you delve deeper into a vault, the corruption and strangeness of the place takes hold. Use the Sanctum Feature table (page 364) to represent the aberrant nature of a vault’s depths.

    ## Delving The Sanctum
    Your passage from the Interior into the Sanctum is triggered by a rolled result on the Interior Feature table: “Transition into the Sanctum.”

    If you [Undertake an Expedition](#Undertake-an-Expedition) into a vault, you can also use the progress track as a gauge for your current location. Once you reach six or more filled progress boxes, you have reached the Sanctum.

    If you envision a vault as particularly strange and perilous, use the Sanctum as the framing for the entirety of your exploration. If it is relatively mundane, use only the Interior.

    ## Revealing the Vault’s Purpose
    If the original function of the vault is a mystery, you can use the Vault Purpose table (page 361) to see what lies at its heart. Check this oracle when your story leads to a reveal of the site’s true nature, such as when you [Finish an Expedition](#Finish-an-Expedition).

    ## Perils and Opportunities
    Use these tables to help envision a complication or favorable circumstance within a vault, such as when you [Explore a Waypoint](#Explore-a-Waypoint) and are prompted to envision a peril or opportunity.
